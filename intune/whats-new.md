## Week of May 13, 2019 

### App management

#### Intune policies update authentication method and Company Portal app installation  <!-- 1927359 idready wnready-->
On devices already enrolled via Setup Assistant through one of Apple’s corporate device enrollment methods, Intune will no longer support the Company Portal when it is manually installed by end users from the app store. This change is only relevant when you authenticate with Apple Setup Assistant during enrollment. This change also only affects iOS devices enrolled through:  
* Apple configurator

* Apple Business Manager

* Apple School Manager

* Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP)

If users install the Company Portal app from the App store, and then try to enroll these devices through it, they will receive an error. These devices will be expected to only use the Company Portal when it's been pushed, automatically, by Intune during enrollment. Enrollment profiles in Intune in the Azure portal will be updated so that you can specify how devices authenticate and if they receive the Company Portal app. If you want your DEP device users to have the Company Portal, you will need to specify your preferences in an enrollment profile. 

In addition, the **Identify your device** screen in the Company Portal app will soon become obsolete.  

To install the Company Portal on already-enrolled DEP devices, you will need to go to Intune > Client apps, and push it as a managed app with app configuration policies. 

#### Configure how end users update a line-of-business (LOB) app using an app protection policy <!-- 3568384 -->
You can now configure where your end users can get an updated version of a line-of-business (LOB) app. End users will see this feature in the **min app version** conditional launch dialog, which will prompt end users to update to a minimum version of the LOB app. You must provide these update details as part of your LOB app protection policy (APP). This feature is available on iOS and Android. On iOS, this feature requires the app to be integrated (or wrapped using the wrapping tool) with the Intune SDK for iOS v. 10.0.7 or above. On Android, this feature would require the latest Company Portal. To configure how an end user updates a LOB app, the app needs a managed app configuration policy sent to it with the key, `com.microsoft.intune.myappstore`. The value sent will define which store the end user will download the app from. If the app is deployed via the Company Portal, the value must be `CompanyPortal`. For any other store, you must enter a complete URL.

#### Intune management extension PowerShell scripts  <!-- 3734186 idready -->
You can configure PowerShell scripts to run with the user’s admin privileges on the device. For more information, see [Use PowerShell scripts on Windows 10 devices in Intune](intune-management-extension.md) and [Win32 app management](apps-win32-app-management.md).

#### Android Enterprise app management <!-- 4459905 -->
To make it easier for IT admins to configure and use Android Enterprise management, Intune will automatically add four common Android Enterprise related apps to the Intune admin console. The four Android Enterprise apps are the following:

- **[Microsoft Intune](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.intune)** - Used for Android Enterprise fully managed scenarios.
- **[Microsoft Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator)** -  Helps you sign-in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification.
- **[Intune Company Portal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal)** - Used for App Protection Policies (APP) and Android Enterprise work profile scenarios.
- [Managed Home Screen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.launcher.enterprise) - Used for Android Enterprise dedicated/kiosk scenarios.

Previously, IT admins would need to manually find and approve these apps in the [Managed Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps) as part of setup. This change removes those previously manual steps to make it easier and faster for customers to use Android Enterprise management.

Admins will see these four apps automatically added to their Intune apps list at the time that they first connect their Intune tenant to managed Google Play. For more information, see [Connect your Intune account to your Managed Google Play account](connect-intune-android-enterprise.md). For tenants that have already connected their tenant or who already use Android Enterprise, there is nothing admins need to do. Those four apps will automatically show up within 7 days of the completion of the May 2019 service roll out.

### Device configuration

## Week of April 22, 2019

### Use Compliance Manager to create assessments for Microsoft Intune<!-- 4404750 -->

[Compliance Manager](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ComplianceManager) (opens another Microsoft site) is a workflow-based risk assessment tool in the Microsoft Service Trust Portal. It enables you to track, assign, and verify your organization’s regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft services. You can create your own compliance assessment with Office 365, Azure, Dynamics, Professional Services, and Intune. Intune has two assessments available - FFIEC and GDPR.

Compliance Manager helps you focus your efforts by breaking down controls - controls managed by Microsoft, and controls managed by your organization. You can complete the assessments, and then export and print the assessments.

[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/FFIEC) (opens another Microsoft site) compliance is a set of standards for online banking issued by FFIEC. It's the most requested assessment for financial institutions that use Intune. It interprets how Intune helps meet FFIEC cybersecurity guidelines related to public cloud workloads. Intune’s FFIEC assessment is the second FFIEC assessment in Compliance Manager.

In the following example, you can see the breakdown for FFIEC controls. Microsoft covers 64 controls. You're responsible for the remaining 12 controls.

![See a sample Intune assessment for FFIEC, including the customer actions and Microsoft actions](./media/intune-ffiec-assessment-status.png)

[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/privacy/gdpr/gdpr-overview) (opens another Microsoft site) is a European Union (EU) law that helps protect the rights of individuals and their data. GDPR is the most requested assessment to help comply with privacy regulations. 

In the following example, you see the breakdown for GDPR controls. Microsoft covers 49 controls. You're responsible for the remaining 66 controls.

#### Expanded support for Android Enterprise fully managed devices  (Preview)  <!--   3903241, 3903244, 3903246   -->
Still in a public preview, we've expanded our support of Android Enterprise fully managed devices ([first announced in January of 2019](whats-new.md#week-of-january-14-2019) to include the following: 

- On fully managed and dedicated devices, you can create [compliance policies](compliance-policy-create-android-for-work.md) to include password rules and operating system requirements (**Device compliance** > **Policies** > **Create policy** > **Android Enterprise** for platform > **Device owner** for profile type). 

  On dedicated devices, the device may show as **Not compliant**. Conditional access isn't available on dedicated devices. Be sure to complete any tasks or actions to get dedicated devices compliant with your assigned policies.

- [Conditional access](conditional-access.md) - Conditional access policies that apply to Android also apply to Android Enterprise fully managed devices. Users can now register their fully managed device in Azure Active Directory using the **Microsoft Intune app**. Then, see and resolve any compliance issues to access organizational resources.

- New end user app (Microsoft Intune app) - There is a new end user app for Android fully managed devices called **Microsoft Intune**. This new app is light-weight and modern, and provides similar functionally as the Company Portal app, but for fully managed devices. For more information, see [Microsoft Intune app on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.intune).

To set up Android fully managed devices, go to **Device enrollment** > **Android enrollment** > **Corporate-owned, fully managed user devices**. Support for fully managed Android devices remains in preview, and some Intune features might not be fully functional.  

To learn more about this preview, see our blog, [Microsoft Intune - Preview 2 for Android Enterprise Fully Managed devices](https://aka.ms/preview2_AE_fullymanaged).


### Device enrollment

#### Configure profile to skip some screens during Setup Assistant <!-- 2276470  wnstaged-->
When you create a macOS enrollment profile, you can configure it to skip any of the following screens when a user goes through the Setup Assistant:
- Appearance
- Display Tone
- iCloudStorage
If you create a new profile or edit a profile, the selected skip screens need to sync with the Apple MDM server.  Users can issue a manual sync of the devices so that there is no delay in picking up the profile changes.
For more information, see [Automatically enroll macOS devices with the Device Enrollment Program or Apple School Manager](device-enrollment-program-enroll-macos.md).

#### Bulk device naming when enrolling corporate iOS devices<!--3566569  -->
When using one of Apple's corporate enrollment methods (DEP/ABM/ASM), you can set a device name format to automatically name incoming iOS devices. You can specify a format that includes the device type and serial number in your template. To do so, choose **Intune** > **Device enrollment** > **Apple enrollment** > **Enrollment program tokens** > **Select a token** >**Create profile** > **Device naming format**. You can edit existing profiles, but only newly synced devices will have the name applied.

#### Updated default timeout message on Enrollment Status Page <!-- 3959331 -->
We've updated the default timeout message users see when the Enrollment Status Page (ESP) exceeds the timeout value specified in the ESP profile. The new default message is what users see and helps them understand the next actions to take with their ESP deployment.  

### Device management

#### Retire noncompliant devices  <!-- 1827291   -->
This feature has been delayed and will come in a future release.


### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### Intune Data Warehouse V1.0 changes reflecting back to beta <!-- 4403765 -->
When V1.0 was first introduced in 1808, it differed in some significant ways from the beta API. In 1903 those changes will be reflected back into the beta API version. If you have important reports that use the beta API version, we strongly recommend switching those reports to V1.0 to avoid breaking changes. For more information, see [Change log for the Intune Data Warehouse API](reports-changelog.md#1903-part-2).

#### Monitor Security Baseline status (public preview) <!-- 3082047 --> 
We've added a [per-category view](security-baselines-monitor.md#per-category-view) to the monitoring of security baselines. (Security baselines remain in preview). The per-category view displays each category from the baseline along with the percentage of devices that fall into each status group for that category. You can now see how many devices don't match the individual categories, are misconfigured, or are not applicable.

### Role-based access control

#### Scope tags for Apple VPP tokens <!--2371886  -->
You can now add scope tags to Apple VPP tokens. Only users assigned with the same scope tag will have access to the Apple VPP token with that tag. VPP apps and ebooks purchased with that token inherit its scope tags. For more information about scope tags, see [Use RBAC and scope tags](scope-tags.md).

### App management

#### Intune will leverage Google Play Protect APIs on Android devices <!-- 2577355   -->
Some IT admins are faced with a BYOD landscape where end users may end up rooting or jailbreaking their mobile phone. This behavior, while sometimes not ill-intentioned, results in a bypass of many Intune policies that are set in order to protect the organization's data on end user devices. Thus, Intune provides root and jailbreak detection for both enrolled and unenrolled devices. With this release, Intune will now leverage Google Play Protect APIs to add to our existing root detection checks for unenrolled devices. While Google does not share the entirety of the root detection checks that occur, we expect these APIs to detect users who have rooted their devices for any reason from device customization to being able to get newer OS updates on older devices. These users can then be blocked from accessing corporate data, or their corporate accounts can be wiped from their policy enabled apps. For additional value, the IT admin will now have several reporting updates within the Intune App Protection blade - the "Flagged Users" report will show which users are detected via Google Play Protect's SafetyNet API scan, the "Potentially Harmful Apps" report will show which apps are detected via Google's Verify Apps API scanning. This feature is available on Android.

#### Win32 app information available in Troubleshooting blade <!-- 2617342   -->
You can now collect failure log files for a Win32 app installation from the Intune app **Troubleshooting** blade. For more information about app installation troubleshooting, see [Troubleshoot app installation issues](troubleshoot-app-install.md) and [Troubleshoot Win32 app issues](apps-win32-app-management.md#troubleshoot-win32-app-issues).

- Failure when app store is disabled
- Failure to find VPP license for app
- Failure to install system apps with MDM provider
- Failure to install apps when device is in lost mode or kiosk mode
- Failure to install app when user is not signed in to the App Store

In Intune, select **Client apps** > **Apps** > "App name" > **Device install status**. New error messages will be available in the **Status details** column.

#### New App categories screen in the Company Portal app for Windows 10<!-- 3834780  -->
A new screen called **App categories** has been added to improve the app browsing and selection experience in Company Portal for Windows 10. Users will now see their apps sorted under categories such as **Featured**, **Education**, and **Productivity**. This change appears in Company Portal versions 10.3.3451.0 and later. To view the new screen, see [What's new in the app UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/whats-new-app-ui).

#### macOS users are prompted to update their password <!-- 1873216 -->
Intune is enforcing the **ChangeAtNextAuth** setting on macOS devices. This setting impacts end-users and devices that have compliance password policies or device restriction password profiles. End users are prompted once to update their password. This prompt happens whenever a user first runs a task that requires authentication, such as signing in to the device. Users can also be prompted to update their password when doing anything that requires administrative privileges, such as requesting keychain access. 

Any new or existing password policy changes by the administrator prompts end users again to update their password.

### Device configuration

#### Use Microsoft-recommended settings with Security Baselines (Public Preview) <!-- 2055484   -->

Intune integrates with other services that focus on security, including Windows Defender ATP and Office 365 ATP. Customers are asking for a common strategy and a cohesive set of end-to-end security workflows across the Microsoft 365 services. Our goal is to align strategies to build solutions that bridge security operations and common administrator tasks. 
In Intune, we aim to accomplish this goal by publishing a set of Microsoft recommended “Security baselines” (**Intune** > **Security baselines**).  An administrator can create security policies directly from these baselines, and then deploy them to their users. You can also customize the best practice recommendations to meet the needs of your organization. Intune makes sure that devices stay in compliance with these baselines, and notifies administrators of users or devices that aren't in compliance.

This feature is in public preview so any profiles created now will not move over to Security Baselines templates that are generally available (GA). You shouldn’t plan to use these preview templates in your production environment.

To learn more about security baselines, see [Create a Windows 10 security baseline in Intune](security-baselines-monitor.md).

This feature applies to:
Windows 10 and later

#### Non-Administrators can enable BitLocker on Windows 10 devices joined to Azure AD<!-- 2147379   -->​
When you enable BitLocker settings on Windows 10 devices (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **Endpoint protection** for profile type > **Windows Encryption**), you add BitLocker settings. ​
​
This update includes a new BitLocker setting to allow standard users (non-administrators) to enable encryption. ​
​
To see the settings, go to [Endpoint protection settings for Windows 10](endpoint-protection-windows-10.md#windows-encryption).​

This update includes a new System Center Configuration Manager compliance setting (**Device compliance** > **Policies** > **Create policy** > **Windows 10 and later** > **Configuration Manager Compliance**). Configuration Manager sends signals to Intune compliance. Using this setting, you can require all Configuration Manager signals to return "compliant".

For example, you require all software updates to be installed on devices. In Configuration Manager, this requirement has the “Installed” state. If any programs on the device are in unknown state, then the device is non-compliant in Intune.

[Configuration Manager Compliance](compliance-policy-create-windows.md#configuration-manager-compliance) describes this setting.

#### Group Windows Autopilot-enrolled devices by correlator ID <!-- 2075110 -->
Intune now supports grouping Windows devices by a correlator ID when enrolled using [Autopilot for existing devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/New-Windows-Autopilot-capabilities-and-expanded-partner-support/ba-p/260430) through Configuration Manager. The correlator ID is a parameter of the Autopilot configuration file. Intune will automatically set the [Azure AD device attribute enrollmentProfileName](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership#using-attributes-to-create-rules-for-device-objects) to equal "OfflineAutopilotprofile-<correlator ID>". This allows arbitrary Azure AD dynamic groups to be created based off correlator ID via the enrollmentprofileName attribute for offline Autopilot enrollments. For more information, see [Windows Autopilot for existing devices](enrollment-autopilot.md#windows-autopilot-for-existing-devices).

#### Intune app protection policies <!-- 2984657 -->
Intune app protection policies allow you to configure various data protection settings for Intune protected apps, such as Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Word. We’ve change the look and feel of these settings for both [iOS](app-protection-policy-settings-ios.md) and [Android](app-protection-policy-settings-android.md) to make it easier to find individual settings. There are three categories of policy settings:
- **Data relocation** - This group includes the data loss prevention (DLP) controls, like cut, copy, paste, and save-as restrictions. These settings determine how users interact with data in the apps.
- **Access requirements** - This group contains the per-app PIN options that determine how the end user accesses the apps in a work context.  
- **Conditional launch** - This group holds settings like the minimum OS settings, jailbreak and rooted device detection, and offline grace periods.  
  
The functionality of the settings doesn’t change, but it will be easier to find them when you work in the policy authoring flow.

### Intune apps

#### Intune will support a maximum package size of 8 GB for LOB apps <!-- 1727158 -->

### Monitor and troubleshoot

#### New Intune Support Experience in the Microsoft 365 Device Management portal <!-- 3076965 -->
We are rolling out a new Help and Support experience for Intune in the [Microsoft 365 Device Management portal]( http://devicemanagement.microsoft.com). The new experience lets you describe your problem in your own words and receive troubleshooting insight and web-based remediation content. These solutions are offered via a rule-based machine learning algorithm, driven by user inquiries.  

In addition to issue-specific guidance, you can also use the new case creation workflow to open a support case by email or phone.  

For customers who are part of the rollout, this new experience replaces the current Help and Support experience of a static set of pre-selected options that are based on the area of the console you are in when you open Help and Support.  

*This new Help and Support experience is being rolled out to some but not all tenants and is available in the Device Management portal. Participants for this new experience are randomly selected from the available Intune tenants. New tenants will be added as we expand the rollout.*

Always-on VPN connections stay connected, or immediately reconnect when the user unlocks their device, when the device restarts, or when the wireless network changes. You can also put the connection in "lockdown" mode, which blocks all network traffic until the VPN connection is active.
You can enable Always-on VPN in **Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Android enterprise** for platform > **Device restrictions** > **Connectivity** settings.

#### Issue SCEP certificates to user-less devices <!-- 1744554 -->
Currently, certificates are issued to users. With this update, SCEP certificates can be issued to devices, including user-less devices such as kiosks (**Device configuration** > **Profiles** > **Create profile** > **Windows 10 and later** for platform > **SCEP certificate** for profile). 
Other updates include:
- The **Subject** property in an SCEP profile is now a custom textbox and can include new variables. 
- The **Subject alternative name (SAN)** property in an SCEP profile is now a table format and can include new variables. In the table, an admin can add an attribute and fill out the value in a custom textbox. The SAN will support the following attributes: 
  - DNS
  - Email address
  - UPN

  These new variables can be added with static text in a custom value textbox. For example, the DNS attribute can be added as `DNS = {{AzureADDeviceId}}.domain.com`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Curly brackets, semicolons, and pipe symbols “ { } ; | ” will not work in the static text of the SAN. Curly brackets must only enclose one of the new device certificate variables to be accepted for either `Subject` or `Subject alternative name`. 

New device certificate variables:  

```
"{{AAD_Device_ID}}",
"{{Device_Serial}}",
"{{Device_IMEI}}",
"{{SerialNumber}}",
"{{IMEINumber}}",
"{{AzureADDeviceId}}",
"{{WiFiMacAddress}}",
"{{IMEI}}",
"{{DeviceName}}",
"{{FullyQualifiedDomainName}}",
"{{MEID}}",
```

> [!NOTE]
>  - `{{FullyQualifiedDomainName}}` only works for Windows and domain-joined devices. 
>  -  When specifying device properties such as IMEI, Serial Number, and Fully Qualified Domain Name in the subject or SAN for a device certificate, be aware that these properties could be spoofed by a person with access to the device.
